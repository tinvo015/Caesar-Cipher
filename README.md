# Caesar-Cipher
Decodes a traditional Caesar Cipher.

The inputted text cannot contain a new line character because that is used by the program to determine whether the user input has terminated.

If the rotation number is known, the inputted text will be rotated by that number. 

If the rotation number is not known, all 25 possible rotations are used and will be outputted. The user will then have to look at all outputs to determine which one is correct.
